Airtable utility that programmatically creates questions from airtable fields. 

Add new fields to airtable and it creates the questions for you, then saves the answers back to airtable. 

Does not with with select fields due to the limitations of the airtable API

## Needs Fixing: 
There is some weirdness with the interview mixing up the variable names

Need to fix the attachment feature so it sends them to the API properly
